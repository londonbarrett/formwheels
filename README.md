component, then

### Fields

You need to connect every field to the form state by using value and
setValue, additionaly you can display errors and check if the field has
been touched.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useFormState } from 'formwheels';

const Input = (props) => {
  const { errors, setValue, touched, value } = useFormState(props);
  return (
    <div>
      <label>{props.label}</label>
      <input
        {...props}
        onChange={event => setValue(event.target.value)}
        value={value}
      />
      <ul>
        {errors.map(
          error => (
            <li>{error}</li>
          )
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Input;
```

### Submit

```js
import React from 'react';

const Submit = () => {
  const { hasErrors } = useFormState();
  return <input type="submit" disabled={hasErrors} />;
};

export default Submit;
```

### Form

Once you have created your connected fields, you can compose your form

> Warning: Every Form should have a name.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Form, validators } from 'formwheels';

const CommentForm = () => (
  <Form name="comment">
    <Input
      label="Name"
      name="name"
      validators={[
        validators.isNotEmpty('First Name should not be empty'),
      ]}
    />
    <Input
      label="Age"
      name="age"
      validators={[
        validators.isNotEmpty('Age should not be empty'),
        validators.isNumber('Age should be a number'),
        validators.greaterThan(16, 'Age should be over 16'),
      ]}
    />
    <Input
      label="Comment"
      name="comment"
      validators={[
        validators.isNotEmpty('First Name should not be empty'),
      ]}
    />
    <Submit/>
  </Form>
);

export default CommentForm;
```
